🏦 I’m a final-year Master’s in IT student at Somaiya Vidyavihar University, Mumbai, **with 1.3 years of experience** analyzing user data, reviews, and both quantitative and qualitative insights to support product design decisions.

✍🏻 I work with **Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI** to clean real-world data, uncover trends, and communicate findings clearly. Currently diving deeper into Deep Learning and NLP, exploring how machines understand language and context.

🌍 I’m passionate about applying data skills in **Healthcare, FinTech, and Mobility**, where insights drive meaningful impact.

🚀 Always open to challenging problems, collaborative projects, and continuous learning.
