# About Me

Hi, I’m **Aryan**. I am Data Analyst while finishing my **Master’s in IT, with a focus on Natural Language Processing**, at Somaiya Vidyavihar University. My coursework has **pushed my GPA to 9.00, at semester 1 and 8.05 at semester 2**.

Day to day, I use **Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI** to sift through messy real-world data, spot hidden trends, and weave those findings into clear, practical stories for the team. At the moment **I am constantly learning - deep learning and language models**, curiosity driving me to see how code can learn to read, write, and understand context the way people do.

I’m especially interested in applying these skills in impactful **domains like Healthcare, FinTech, and Mobility**. Where data can truly transform how we live, move, and make decisions.

Always eager for **tough problems, hands-on side projects, and cross-functional teams**, I view every new challenge as a chance to learn something fresh and then share that learning with others.
