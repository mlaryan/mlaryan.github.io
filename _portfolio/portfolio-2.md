### Background:

A toy business operating across multiple stores in Mexico and offering a variety of toy products is looking to gain a clearer picture of its **product sales**, **profitability**, and **inventory usage** across all store locations.

This project analyzes performance across **multiple stores**, **product categories**, and **time periods**, to uncover key insights.

### Business Use Cases / Applications:

To understand:
- Sales and profit trends across different products and stores
- Inventory inefficiencies (e.g: high stock but low sales)
- Products with high profit margins but low sales volume
- Best-performing product categories by store and over time
- Ideas for optimizing pricing based on performance trends

### Dataset:

### Tech Stack Used:

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, Jupyter Notebook

### üîç Data Cleaning & Processing Steps:

- Imported the dataset using **Pandas**
- Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.isnull().sum()` to understand the structure, data types, and missing values
- Detected some **outliers** in the data (through visualization) ‚Äî but chose to **retain them** as they might reflect real-world business cases or exceptional events
- Corrected the **Date column's datatype** for proper time-based analysis
