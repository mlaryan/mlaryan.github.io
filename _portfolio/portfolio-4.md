### Background:
Imagine needing to truly understand what's happening with pharmaceutical sales. That's precisely what this project sets out to do. We've built an intuitive dashboard, powered by Power BI, that takes all our raw sales figures and turns them into clear, actionable insights. Think of it as a detailed map that shows us exactly where our products are selling, through which channels, and how our sales teams are performing, all based on a robust and well-organized data foundation. It's about bringing clarity to complex sales data so we can make smarter decisions, faster.

**Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI report that empowers sales managers, marketing teams, and executives to

- Monitor overall sales performance and identify deviations from targets.
- Analyze sales trends by various dimensions (e.g., product, channel, region, time).
- Evaluate the performance of sales representatives and distributors.
- Understand customer purchasing behavior and identify key customer segments
- Support strategic planning for product launches, marketing campaigns, and sales force allocation

###  Tools & Technologies Used:
